# fake_detection
### Summary

The Jupyter notebook (`google-hack2.ipynb`) develops a deepfake detection model using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset. It processes video frames to classify videos as `REAL` or `FAKE`, achieving predictions like a `0.4584` score for a test video (classified `REAL`).

### Technical Overview
- **Setup**: Uses TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV; runs on CPU (CUDA disabled) in a Kaggle environment with T4 GPU.
- **Data**: 401 training (imbalanced: more `FAKE`) and 400 test videos; metadata from JSON.
- **Model**: Deep learning model (likely LSTM/Transformer) processes frame sequences; uses Bayesian optimization for tuning.
- **Inference**: Predicts on test videos, e.g., `FAKE` with a `0.6369` average score (std dev: `0.0825`).
- **Challenges**: Missing functions (`load_video`, `prepare_single_video`), CPU usage, and dataset imbalance.

### Business Prospects
- **Market**: High demand for deepfake detection in media, social platforms, legal, and corporate sectors.
- **Advantages**: Scalable with GPU, potential for high accuracy via optimization.
- **Challenges**: Evolving deepfake tech, regulatory compliance, competition from Deepware/Sensity.
- **Opportunities**: Real-time detection, multi-modal analysis, partnerships with social media platforms.
